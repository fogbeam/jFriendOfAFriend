Fogbeam's [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org) library in Java

Written by [Fogbeam Labs](http://www.fogbeam.com) for use in [Quoddy](https://github.com/fogbeam/Quoddy), 
[Neddick](https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick) and other projects, the goal is to eventually provide a 100% spec 
compliant FOAF library, in Java, licensed under the Apache License v2 (ALv2).  Right now this isn't even 
close to 100% done, and it will be evolving along with our support for FOAF in Quoddy and Neddick.
